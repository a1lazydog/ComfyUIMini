## FAQ

### **Q**: I can't import my workflow.

-   **A**: You need to save your workflow in API Format to be able to import it as regular saving doesn't provide enough information to list all available inputs. For a guide on how to enable this option see video [here](https://imgur.com/a/YsZQu83).

### **Q**: Can you access the WebUI outside of the local network?

-   **A**: Yes you can through the use of port forwarding, however this carries security risks as it will allow anyone to potentially connect to your WebUI. As the process of setting up port forwarding varies greatly depending on your internet service provider I am unable to give specific instructions, however you may be able to find help by searching '_[your ISP] enable port forwarding_'.

### **Q**: How do I use date replacement in workflow inputs?

-   **A**: In textarea inputs, you can use placeholders like `%date:YYYY-MM-DD%` to automatically insert the current date and time when the workflow runs.

### **Q**: What are .meta files?

-   **A**: `.meta` files contain ComfyUIMini-specific metadata (titles, descriptions, input configurations) separate from the original workflow JSON files. This preserves the original workflow files while maintaining the ComfyUIMini interface.
